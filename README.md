### 17/12/2021 (Phuong)

- Can update image in s3 by delete and upload more into the same folder
- Search/sort/pagination with name, type and price

### 17/12/2021 (Trang)

  pagination)

### 16/12/2021 (Phuong)

- Added upload images using S3 bucket
- Change type of attribute `description` in class House
- Link to image url: https://realestatemgt.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/dataset/1/1_bathroom.jpg
> where 1 is the row id
- Pagination and sort with house and users, search by name with `house` and search by name/phone/email with `user`

### 4/12/2021 (Trang)
- Changed folder structure from class-based to function-based
> It is not necessary to create a Service for each Entity. A Service can wire multiple Repositories. This reduces the number of Services and makes cascading (for example delete all dependent Rentals when a User is deleted) easier. "Important" entities (User, House, Rental) have their own Service classes.
- Added 5 rows of mock data for all classes, relationships included
- Wrote parsers to parse date and time from strings
- Wrote a parser to deserialize field "rental" (actually an ID string) in `payment.json` into nested Rental objects
- Fixed infinite recursion when using GET requests for Rental and Payment due to them referencing each other
- Added manual cascading when deleting User and House: all dependent Deposits, Meetings, and Rentals will be deleted
- Added orphan removal when deleting Rental: all dependent Payments will be deleted
